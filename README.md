# Cat Tinder

This repo contains the front and backend applications for Cat Tinder.  Backend is Ruby on Rails, and front end is done using React.  They are two distinct applications and both need to be run in tandem to run the application in a browser.  See the readme files in each for instructions on how to get started.
